# 0x00. Pascal's Triangle

          
Pascal's triangle is a mathematical pattern that looks like a triangle made of numbers. Each row in the triangle represents a set of numbers, and the numbers in each row are added together to form the numbers in the next row.        

It looks like the example below:          

1       
1 1       
1 2 1      
1 3 3 1      
1 4 6 4 1         
       
Each row starts and ends with the number 1. The numbers in between are created by adding the two numbers directly above them in the previous row.
